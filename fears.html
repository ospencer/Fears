    <h1>Her fears of a Computer Science career.</h1>

        The goal of this project is to encourage more young women to choose Computer Science(CS) as their major in colleges and universities. There is still a huge gap between amount of high school girls and boys who are studying CS. The main reason for that is not that the girls are less interested in the field, but because they believe that they will not be welcomed. For example women earn 57% of all undergraduate degrees. Out of which 42% are in math and statistics and 40% in physical sciences. But when it comes to undergraduate computer and information sciences degrees, women only earn 18%.

        The field of CS has changed a lot since it first got established. Women not only welcomed, but also actively recruited by most companies. There are numerous conferences and events that are specifically organized for women to network, learn, and share their experiences with others. With this public campaign, we would like for high school girls to learn that they will not be alone and isolated. That there is big and vibrant community ready to offer support and advice to them.

        Social media and the Internet in general plays important role in lives of teenagers. By building a well designed website and promote it through social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram would be the best way to reach out to high school girls in order to show them just how much computer science field has changed.

        There are a lot of stereotypes that exist about computer science.  Based on that, young women often have fears about entering male dominated field. One way to deal with those fears is to show from personal experience or real life events, that they are no longer relevant. On the website that we are building, a user will be able to select a “fear” and read a short statement from current college student and young professional who will provide insight on the matter. Other way to deal with those fears is by providing the latest information and statistics that will help young women to better understand the current situation in CS field.
