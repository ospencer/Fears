        #WomenInTechWin is a public campaign dedicated to addressing the fears of high school girls afraid of choosing Computer Science as their college major.
        <br><br>
        There is still a huge gap between the number of male and female college students who are studying CS. It’s not that girls are less interested in the field, but rather they believe that they will not be welcomed. Women earn 57% of all undergraduate degrees, out of which 42% are in math and statistics and 40% in physical sciences. But when it comes to undergraduate computer and information sciences degrees, women only earn 18%. You can find out more

        <br><br>
        There are a lot of stereotypes that exist about computer science, which adds to young women’s fears about entering a male dominated field. This site exists to show that from personal experience or real life events, women are welcome.

            "According to CNET women actually make up about 30% of Computer Science. That is still a minority but it’s improving every year and before too many years may no longer be an issue. So if this is an issue for someone wanting to get into the field of Computer Science, remember that after four years of college there’s a good chance it may no longer be a problem. <br><br>Remember also that the only way to stay a minority in a field is to not join it because you’d be in the minority. If you are without fear and go for it, you can help end the minority and bring more gender equality to Computer Science."

        Harassment in the workplace comes in the form of unwelcome or offensive treatment from others based on things like race, sex, national origin, disability or age. Examples of harassment include pressure for dates or sexual favors, offensive or derogatory jokes, racial or ethnic slurs, cartoons or pictures, or unwelcome comments.

            “Treatment of this nature in the workplace is not only mean, it is entirely unnecessary! In a work environment, there is a job that needs to be done. If someone is spending time going out of their way to harass their coworker, then they are clearly not focusing enough on the larger goals of the company. Also, people working together should feel like a team and encourage each other in all aspects of their lives. Supporting each other as individuals will result in the overall growth of their company. It’s like basketball, you need all team members working together in order to win the game!”

        It is common that people decide to change their career or have a new interest later in their life.

Being an older student studying computer science for the first time means you will be amongst

younger classmates who may have had more practice than you in this field. In these

circumstances, it is easy to get discouraged because the curriculum is moving quickly and you

are likely to have more difficulty than your fellow classmates.

            “I am 27 now and share classes with 19­22 year olds. A large majority of my classmates are

practically fluent in some of the programming languages used in class, whereas, I am still

getting accustomed to the basics. It is a huge challenge for me to keep up with my course

assignments and I often have more difficulty understanding the curriculum. The way I see it, if I

like it, then who cares how long it takes me to understand it. I love computer science! And in

reality, it doesn’t matter if I am having trouble understanding something or if I get frustrated that

I don’t intuitively know how to write a program, like many of my classmates. I will not let my late-
blooming stop me from learning about something I enjoy. And it is important that I know that

failure should never be a reason for me giving up learning how to program. If computer science

is something I am intrigued by and I want to learn more, than a challenge will only prove my

ability to persevere. Also, never be afraid to ask questions or present your trouble

understanding something. I was happy to realize that my younger classmates are more than

happy to assist me. I’ve made many friends this way, as well! Actually, computer science is

constantly changing. In some ways, every computer engineer is continually dabbling and

learning new things. Even though I am not yet fluent in many programming languages, and even

though I am not as knowledgeable as my classmates, I believe that with perseverance and

practice, I will, indeed, be a successful software engineer! :)”

            "This is definitely the wrong mindset to have when thinking about getting into Computer Science. The first thing to remember is that this fear has no basis. Employers don’t care about your gender when hiring you any more than they care about your race, age, religion, or what you had for lunch today. Employers want employees that are good at what they do and that’s the extent of it. An example that demonstrates this is that recruiters at companies don’t ask for information like gender when determining whether to call a person in for an interview. They look at the content of the resume without knowing anything about the person other than what’s on the resume."

            "Here's the first thing that I will tell you: women are just as logical as men, and are just
            as capable as men at the thought processes that are required to be successful software engineers.
            There is no scientific evidence to suggest otherwise. Secondly, programming isn't actually as straightforward
            as one might think. It actually requires a substantial amount of creativity to come up with solutions to many
            very complex problems. It's definitely not always as simple as applying some known algorithm.
            <br><br>
            I have had the pleasure of working with some incredibly talented female engineers while working in the industry. I look to them
            for mentorship, and what they teach me is truly invaluable. The success of being an engineer is not a matter of
            gender, but rather how hard you are willing to work to be great at something you love."

            "Even though, companies like the one depicted in “Silicon Valley” do exist, they are not the only ones. There are plenty of businesses that take diversity very seriously and make everything they can to provide a welcoming atmosphere in order to attract talented people of different ages, genders and races. Such companies like Google, Microsoft and Apple constantly coming up with new idea to encourage young women to join tech world. There is also plenty of support from outside sources. My favorite example is Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing(GHC). It is an annual conference that is attended by both women and men in order to promote diversity, provide networking opportunities, and offer chances to teach and learn. This year it is expected to grow to 15,000 attendees. I personally attended GHC of 2014 and 2015. I had an amazing time meeting various women in tech field and listening to the keynote speakers like Sheryl Sandberg(COO of Facebook) and Megan Smith(CTO of the United States)."
