            "According to CNET women actually make up about 30% of everyone in the field and while that is quite a bit less than half, girls are by no means non-existent. The main problem with this fear though is that it is self-fulfilling. Women that fear going into computer science because they are afraid of being the only ones don’t go into computer science and then cause the minority that they feared in the first place. Therefore the best way to eradicate this fear is to not have it. Of course that may sound a bit obvious but if women can ignore this fear enough to get into computer science then before long there will be enough women in CS that the fear won’t even exist!"

    <div>
      <h2>
        Harassment in the workplace comes in the form of unwelcome or offensive treatment from others based on things like race, sex, national origin, disability or age. Examples of harassment include pressure for dates or sexual favors, offensive or derogatory jokes, racial or ethnic slurs, cartoons or pictures, or unwelcome comments.

            “Treatment of this nature in the workplace is not only mean, it is entirely unnecessary! In a work environment, there is a job that needs to be done. If someone is spending time going out of their way to harass their coworker, then they are clearly not focusing enough on the larger goals of the company. Also, people working together should feel like a team and encourage each other in all aspects of their lives. Supporting each other as individuals will result in the overall growth of their company. It’s like basketball, you need all team members working together in order to win the game!”

They hope to even out the workplace and bring it closer to 50/50."

        Many people believe that software engineering is a man's job, programming is very logical,
        and women just aren't as logical as men.

            "Here's the first thing that I will tell you: women are just as logical as men, and are just
            as capable as men at the thought processes that are required to be successful software engineers.
            There is no scientific evidence to suggest otherwise. Secondly, programming isn't actually as straightforward
            as one might think. It actually requires a substantial amount of creativity to come up with solutions to many
            very complex problems. It's definitely not always as simple as applying some known algorithm.
            <br><br>
            I have had the pleasure of working with some incredibly talented female engineers while working in the industry. I look to them
            for mentorship, and what they teach me is truly invaluable. The success of being an engineer is not a matter of
            gender, but rather how hard you are willing to work to be great at something you love."

        There are a lot of stereotypes that exist about computer science.  Based on that, young women often have fears about entering male dominated field. One way to deal with those fears is to show from personal experience or real life events, that they are no longer relevant. On the website that we are building, a user will be able to select a “fear” and read a short statement from current college student and young professional who will provide insight on the matter. Other way to deal with those fears is by providing the latest information and statistics that will help young women to better understand the current situation in CS field.
